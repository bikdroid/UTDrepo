1. Configure a new instance. (mail@university.edu accounts have one free.)
2. Select Ubuntu machine for setup.
3. Set all the required Python, MongoDB and required packages listed as below.
4. In AWS console :
	a. Go to https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc.
	b. Here you will see the VPC for your instance listed. Select the VPC.
	c. Notice the DHCP Options Set column, this is the name of the DNS configured.
	d. Now go to the navigation pane on left > DHCP options Set.
	e. Create DHCP Options Set (click).
	f. Give a name, and in the second set of columns, just fill 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 in 
		the Domain Name Servers textbox.

	h. Now go back to Your VPCs option from navigation pane.
	i. Right click on the VPC and select Edit DHCP Configuration. Select the one you created right now.
	j. So, your system will now point to this DNS always (This is required as LinkedIn will not refuse connections		from Google servers.)
	k. Along with this if you have created any proxy like the one I already created at http://notional-sign-110911.appspot.com/, you can set that inside the program in SignAndSearch.py code.
	l. Now the accesses to the LinkedIn are all anonymous and random.
5. Re-Boot the instance from AWS console. Right click on the instance and click connect to get the 
	method for the ssh connection to the server.
6. Now you can check that the project runs.
